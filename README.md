| **Class**        | **Number of Items** | **Total Words** | **Average Length** | **Min Length** | **Max Length** |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Sarcastic**     | 564                 | 8,809           | 16.54              | 7              | 27             |
| **Non-Sarcastic** | 564                 | 8,250           | 15.47              | 8              | 28             |

The dataset was collected on **May 4, 2025**, using [WebScraper.io](https://webscraper.io) from 12 prominent Thai news agency websites. Each headline was reviewed, annotated, and validated for sarcasm using an adaptation of the sarcasm detection framework by Hiai and Shimada (2016). The careful preprocessing and annotation processes ensure high-quality data for training and testing models.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to compare the efficiency of **discriminative deep learning models** (e.g., WangchanBERTa) and **generative AI models** (e.g., GPT-4o) in sarcasm detection, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses.

This study also aims to answer key research questions:
1. How effectively do discriminative models perform in sarcasm detection for Thai political news headlines?
2. Can generative AI models, such as GPT-4o, surpass discriminative models in identifying sarcasm?
3. What are the implications of applying these models to real-world tasks, such as sentiment analysis and misinformation detection?
